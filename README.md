# C-Sharp-Live-Project
## **Project Background:**
My last project at the Tech Academy involved working on a Scrum team for a 2-week sprint building a Web Application with ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework.
I enjoyed working on a team and having the opportunity to fix bugs, clean up code and work on both front-end and back-end stories to enhance the site. This is an interactive website for a theatre company called, Theatre Vertigo, providing a content management service for non-technical staff to be able to manage the theatre's content and productions. My team and I worked on the Rental Area of the website, allowing the theatre to rent out space or equipment; including what they are renting, a rental request form, and a survey for their rental experience.

## **Front-End Stories**

## **Style the About page (Main Site)**
I was tasked with creating a new [About]() page for Theatre Vertigo. I created a new view in the Home View folder for the About page and styled the page using HTML and [CSS](). I applied the requirement to include a [color-palette]() provided by Theatre Vertigo, and designed the page to blend with the main portion of the website. Button styles, containers, and hover effects I created match those used in other areas of the website for consistency.
